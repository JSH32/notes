Science is the study of the natural world and the underlying laws of nature
### The process
1. Observe the phenomenon
2. Develop a hypothesis (model, theory) about the phenomenon
3. Use the theory to predict the phenomenon you haven't yet observed
4. Go test the prediction, go back to step 1.
	1. If experiment shows the prediction to be correct, then the theory is supported.
		1. Now try to make other predictions and generalize
	2. If experiment disproves the prediction, then must modify the theory or seek alternate theory

### Assumptions in science
There do EXIST underlying laws of nature, waiting to be discovered. Equivalently the world is not chaotic.

We can apply logical structures (such as math) to discover them.

1. Deductive reasoning works,
	1. Deductive logic: given a set of true statements, the process by which the truth of additional statements is *proven*
	2. Example:
		1. $a \rightarrow  b$ and $b \rightarrow c$ implies that $a \rightarrow  c$ (transitive property)
		2. if $a \rightarrow b$, and $b \rightarrow c$, then it must be true that $a \rightarrow c$.
