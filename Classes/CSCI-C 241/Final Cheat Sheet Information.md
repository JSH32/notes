The cardinality of the powerset of a set A, denoted as \( \left| \mathcal{P}(A) \right| \), is equal to \( 2^{\left| A \right|} \), where \( \left| A \right| \) represents the cardinality (or size) of set \( A \). In simpler terms, it means the number of subsets of a set \( A \), including the empty set and the set itself. So if a set \( A \) has \( n \) elements, its powerset has \( 2^n \) elements.

- Causality indicators: because, since, due to
    - Implication types:
        - $P \rightarrow Q$: "if $P$, then $Q$"; "$Q$ if $P$"; "$P$ only if $Q$"; "$P$ is sufficient for $Q$"; "$Q$ is necessary for $P$"
        - $P \leftrightarrow Q$: "$P$ is necessary and sufficient for $Q$"
        - "$P$ is sufficient for $Q$": $P \rightarrow Q$
        - "$P$ is necessary for $Q$": $Q \rightarrow P$
- Logical Connectives: $\neg, \land, \lor, \oplus, \rightarrow$
- Contradictions: Always FALSE
- Tautology: Always TRUE
- Existential Claims:
    - Proven by providing an example with the property
    - Truth Assignment
- Universal Claims:
    - Proven by demonstrating all instances have the property
    - Truth Table
- Consistency:
    - A set of formulas is consistent if there is an assignment satisfying all formulas
    - Provable with a truth assignment, disprovable with a truth table
- Logical Equivalency $\equiv$:
    - Formulas are logically equivalent if every satisfying assignment for one satisfies the other
    - Provable with matching truth tables, disprovable with a truth assignment
- Validity:
    - Valid if every satisfying assignment for premises satisfies conclusion
    - Invalid if there exists a satisfying assignment for premises not satisfying conclusion
