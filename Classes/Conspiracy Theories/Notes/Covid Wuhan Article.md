- [x] Wuhan and COVID 19 Article ðŸ“… 2023-09-08 âœ… 2024-04-17
	- This assignment asks you to investigate a particular conspiracy, as a journalist would. You will be assigned the particular theory to look at. Different students will receive different assignments. Your final product will be a 1400-word article on the theory, something that will tell readers the basics of this theory, whether it is something that can be believed or not, and other things that a general reader would want to know about the theory. Expose the theory as false, or show it to be something worth considering, or maybe something in between (depending on what you find).
	- In addition to the article, you need to provide text that shows how you gathered information for your article. What sources did you consult? Did you interview anyone? What primary sources were you able to gather?
	- **Your individualized assignment topic is "Wuhan and COVID19." The idea that theÂ coronavirus was purposely created by China in a lab in Wuhan.**

	* Make point about how China hinders this own investigation, causing uncertainty. Virus appears to not be a genetically engineered bio-weapon but weather it was created in the Wuhan Virology lab is unsure.
## Outline
Writing an article is similar to writing an essay in several ways. However, an article often has a less formal and more engaging style, with an emphasis on being easy to read and understand. Here's an outline for your topic:

1. **Title**: Aim for a catchy and informative title, like "Examining the Wuhan COVID-19 Conspiracy Theory".
	* Unraveling the Wuhan COVID-19 Conspiracy
1. **Introduction**: Introduce the topic of the Wuhan COVID-19 conspiracy theory to your readers. This can include a brief overview of the theory and why it's a topic of interest. Open with a hook â€“ a surprising fact, a provocative question, or a compelling anecdote â€“ to catch readers' attention.

1. **Background**: The first main section should provide relevant context. For your topic, you could look at the origins of the Wuhan COVID-19 conspiracy theory, what it entails, and why some people believe in it.

2. **Main Body - Arguments For the Theory**: Present the main reasons, logical or illogical, people believe in this conspiracy. To maintain balance, honestly presenting the main tenets of the theory would be crucial.

3. **Main Body - Arguments Against the Theory**: Detail the counterarguments, evidence against the theory, or expert opinions debunking it. This part of the article has the potential for destroying or affirming the conspiratorial claims.

4. **Impact**: Discuss the impact the theory has had, whether it's on social media, politics, or public behavior during the pandemic.

5. **Critical Evaluation**: Analyze the theory with the evidence you have gathered. Is it entirely unfounded, or does it hold water? Is there a viable middle ground, or is the truth as wild as the theory suggests? This gives you room to share your opinion within the bounds of journalistic objectivity.

6. **Conclusion**: Summarize the main points of your article and present your final thoughts on the theory based on your research. In this section, you could also suggest future research that could help further clarify the questions this theory raises.

7. **Sources**: Always remember to cite your sources. Journalism operates on transparency and truth.

As for the writing style, remember that you're trying to engage your reader. Use straightforward language, vary your sentence structure, and break long sections into shorter paragraphs to aid readability. You can use anecdotes, quotes, and descriptive language, and don't be afraid to let your voice shine through your writing.
