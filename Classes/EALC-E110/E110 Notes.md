### Cartoon: Evolution of Modern Japanese Manga

- **Relationship between Modern Manga and its Predecessors:**
    
    - **Ukiyoe and Kibyoshi:** Ukiyoe, a genre of Japanese woodblock prints, provided a visual foundation for manga, especially in artistic styles and the portrayal of daily life and folklore. Kibyoshi, literally "yellow covers," were picture books for adults in the Edo period, and can be considered the world's first comic books. They featured narratives with illustrations and were an early form of storytelling that influenced narrative structures in modern manga.
    - **From Static to Dynamic:** While ukiyoe prints were static images, modern manga incorporates dynamic panel transitions and varied layouts that reflect more complex storytelling adapted for contemporary audiences.
- **Western Influences in Manga:**
    
    - **Visual Storytelling Techniques:** The introduction of Western comic strips in the early 20th century brought new elements like sequential art and speech bubbles to Japanese creators, leading to a more sophisticated narrative technique in manga.
    - **Cinematic Influence:** Influenced by Western cinema, manga began to incorporate cinematic techniques such as close-ups, varied angles, and pacing, which added depth and motion to the storytelling.
- **Difference Between Palm-Sized Lianhuanhua and Modern Manga:**
    
    - **Lianhuanhua:** Originating in China, these are small-sized picture books that traditionally featured folk tales, historical narratives, and later, propaganda. They are characterized by their small, palm-sized format, making them portable and accessible.
    - **Modern Manga:** Unlike the often simpler and more static lianhuanhua, modern manga features complex plots, character development, and is published in various formats from serialized magazine chapters to large tankobon volumes. Manga tends to be more dynamic and diverse in genre, catering to a wide range of demographics.
- **Tezuka Osamu’s Contribution:**
    
    - **Innovative Techniques:** Known as the "Godfather of Manga," Tezuka introduced "cinematic timing" and "frame-by-frame" development in his works, significantly enhancing the visual narrative style of manga.

### Fashion and National Identity:

- **Rise and Fall of the Qipao (Cheung Sam):**
    
    - **Historical Emergence:** The qipao, originally a Manchu dress, was adapted by Han Chinese women in the early 20th century, particularly during the 1920s in Shanghai. It transformed from a loose-fitting style that covered most of the woman's body to a more form-fitting and shorter style, reflecting modern fashion trends and the liberal attitudes of the time.
    - **Symbol of Modernity:** By the 1930s and 1940s, the qipao had become a symbol of modern Chinese femininity. It was seen as both stylish and traditional, embodying the new woman of the modern era. Its popularity peaked as it became associated with high society and urban sophistication.
    - **Decline and Cultural Shifts:** The prominence of the qipao waned with the political changes in China, particularly after the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949. The adoption of more uniform and androgynous clothing styles like the Mao suit under communist rule marked a move away from what was seen as bourgeois clothing.
    - **Contemporary Revival:** In recent decades, there has been a revival of the qipao as a symbol of cultural heritage and national pride, particularly in formal settings and during traditional festivals. This revival is part of a broader resurgence of interest in traditional Chinese culture.
- **Kimono and Sartorial Dualism in Modern Japan:**
    
    - **Cultural Significance:** The kimono, which literally means "thing to wear," has deep historical roots in Japan. Traditionally, kimonos were worn daily by most Japanese people, but with Western clothing becoming more common in the 20th century, the kimono transitioned to being worn mainly on special occasions.
    - **Sartorial Dualism:** This term reflects the coexistence and tension between Western and Japanese styles of dress in modern Japan. After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan underwent rapid modernization, which included the adoption of Western dress codes by many, especially in business and formal contexts. However, the kimono remains a powerful symbol of Japanese identity and cultural continuity.
    - **Modern Adaptations and Challenges:** The kimono industry today faces challenges such as declining demand and the aging of skilled artisans. However, there has been a movement to reinterpret the kimono in modern fashion contexts, making it more accessible and versatile for casual wear or artistic expression.
    - **Fashion and Identity:** The dualistic approach to fashion in Japan illustrates broader social dynamics, such as the negotiation between tradition and modernity, individual expression versus cultural conformity, and the global interaction of fashion trends.
