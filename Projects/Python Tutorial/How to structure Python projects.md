## Introduction
Here we will explain how to properly structure your Python projects for scalability, clarity, and ease of use. Managing dependencies with Poetry is just one piece of the puzzle. We will also explore how to organize your code into modules, the role of `__init__.py`, and how you can use functions across different Python files. By the end of this chapter, you will not only know how to handle dependencies with Poetry but also how to structure the internal logic of your project.
## What is a Dependency?
Before we proceed, let's clarify what a **dependency** is. A **dependency** is an external package that your project needs to function. For instance, if your project requires working with APIs, you may include the `requests` library as a dependency. As projects grow, managing dependencies becomes crucial, and this is where tools like **Poetry** come into play.

## Why Use Virtual Environments?
A **virtual environment** isolates your project’s dependencies from the system’s global Python installation. This is useful when you have multiple projects that require different versions of the same library. They are stored using managers like Conda or in folders using python's own `virtualenv` tool.
### Benefits of Virtual Environments

1. **Isolation**: Avoids conflicts between project dependencies.
2. **Reproducibility**: Guarantees that your code works the same across different setups.
3. **Portability**: Simplifies sharing your project with others while ensuring it runs in the same environment.

Without virtual environments, managing multiple projects that require different dependencies can lead to compatibility issues.

## What is Poetry?

**Poetry** automates dependency management, virtual environments, and task automation, making it a great tool for Python projects. It simplifies:

1. **Dependency Management**: Automatically resolves and installs dependencies, keeping them in a `pyproject.toml` file so anyone can re-install dependencies at a later point.
2. **Virtual Environment Setup**: Creates and manages a virtual environment for your project.
3. **Lock File**: Ensures consistent dependency versions across machines via the `poetry.lock` file.
4. **Task Automation**: Allows you to define and automate common tasks.
5. **Project Packaging**: Simplifies building and publishing your project as a Python package.

### Installing Poetry
To start using Poetry, you need to install it on your system. Poetry is compatible with Python 3.7 and above. Here’s how to install it:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to download and install Poetry
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
This will download and install the latest version of Poetry.

3. After the installation is complete, you might need to add Poetry to your system’s PATH so you can access it from the terminal. To do this, follow the instructions printed at the end of the installation process. Typically, you can run a command like this:
4. `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`
5. Verify poetry is installed by running `poetry --version`

## Structuring Your Python Project
Now that we’ve set up Poetry, let's focus on structuring a Python project. A well-structured project improves maintainability and readability, especially as it grows.
### Basic Structure

Here’s a common structure for Python projects:
```
my_project/ 
│
├── my_project/ │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── core.py │ └── utils.py ├── tests/ │ └── test_core.py ├── pyproject.toml ├── README.md └── LICENSE
```
